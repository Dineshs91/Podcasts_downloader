##Podcast_Download

Everyday i visit [talkpython] (https://talkpython.fm/ "Talk Python") to check latest updates.

A small script which does the same, and downloads the latest episode.


#### How I run.
I run the script as a cron-job everyday at 6 AM to download the episode and to listen on way to work.

##### Up-next

* As i listen to multiple podcasts i will keep adding them to the list.
* Implement a notification system to intimate the user when a new episode is downloaded
